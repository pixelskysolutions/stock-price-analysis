# ⏱️ Module 4: Financial Modeling & Time Series  

## 📌 Executive Summary  
This module focuses on **time series analysis and forecasting** — one of the most essential skillsets in quantitative finance and algorithmic modeling.  

We begin with **time series exploration and decomposition** to understand patterns such as trend, seasonality, and residual noise. Then, we progress into **ARIMA modeling** for forecasting — from model selection and diagnostics to prediction and evaluation.  

By the end of this module, you’ll have built, optimized, and interpreted a **fully functional time series forecasting pipeline** — capable of producing insights and metrics used in both **financial prediction and operational analytics**.

## 🔹 Core Topics Covered  
- **Time Series Fundamentals** – structure, stationarity, autocorrelation.  
- **Decomposition Analysis** – separating trend, seasonal, and residual components.  
- **Forecasting Models** – AR, MA, ARIMA, and model diagnostics.  
- **Model Optimization** – parameter tuning via AIC/BIC selection.  
- **Forecast Evaluation** – RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and confidence intervals.
