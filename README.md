🐍 PYTHON FINANCE MASTER COURSE – PORTFOLIO

Welcome to my Python–Finance–Master–Course Portfolio, where 
I document my journey of mastering Python for financial analysis, 
automation, and data-driven investing.

Each module contains hands-on projects, guided notebooks, and explanations — 
built step by step, like a real course.

📂 MODULES & PROJECTS
PHASE 1 – FOUNDATIONS

📘 MODULE 1: PYTHON & FINANCIAL DATA BASICS

🔸PROJECT 2: CREDIT SCORING DATASET ANALYSIS
→ Practice SQL basics (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`), aggregation functions, 
  window functions, and combine SQL with Python visualizations to produce a mini dashboard.

📘 MODULE 3: PROBABILITY, STATISTICS & RISK

🔸PROJECT 1: DICE, COINS, AND STOCK RETURNS SIMULATION
  In this notebook we explore probability basics using coin flips, dice rolls, and simulated
  stock returns. 
🔗 [View Notebook](https://github.com/pixelskysolutions/stock-price-analysis/blob/main/MODULE-3/Dice-Coins-and-Stock-Returns-Simulation.ipynb)

🔸PROJECT 2: RISK METRICS & VALUE-AT-RISK (VaR)
  In this notebook we estimate financial risk using different Value-at-Risk (VaR) methods.
🔗 [View Notebook](https://github.com/pixelskysolutions/stock-price-analysis/blob/main/MODULE-3/Risk-Metrics-%26-Value-at-Risk.ipynb)

🔸PROJECT 3: RISK METRICS – VALUE-AT-RISK & CONDITIONAL (VaR)
  In this project, we extend our Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis by adding 
  Conditional VaR (CVaR), also called Expected Shortfall (ES).
🔗 [View Notebook](https://github.com/pixelskysolutions/stock-price-analysis/blob/main/MODULE-3/Risk_Metrics_Value_at_Risk_%26_Conditional_VaR.ipynb)

🔸PROJECT 4: PORTFOLIO RISK & DIVERSIFICATION
  This notebook explores how asset correlation and weights affect portfolio risk.
🔗 [View Notebook](https://github.com/pixelskysolutions/stock-price-analysis/blob/main/MODULE-3/Portfolio_Risk_and_Diversification.ipynb)

📘 MODULE 4: FINANCIAL MODELING & TIME SERIES

🔸PROJECT 1: TIME SERIES EXPLORATION — PRICES, RETURNS & ROLLING STATISTICS
  In this notebook, we introduce time series analysis by working with simulated stock prices and returns.
  We'll explore rolling statistics & visualize trends. 
🔗 [View Notebook](https://github.com/pixelskysolutions/stock-price-analysis/blob/main/MODULE-4/Time_Series_Exploration.ipynb)

🔸PROJECT 2: TIME SERIES DECOMPOSITION & TREND ANALYSIS
  In this notebook we explore trend, seasonality, and randomness within a time series using
  decomposition and autocorrelation tools.
🔗 [View Notebook](https://github.com/pixelskysolutions/stock-price-analysis/blob/main/MODULE-4/Time_Series_Decomposition_%26_Trend_Analysis.ipynb)

🔸PROJECT 3: TIME SERIES FORECASTING USING ARIMA MODELS
  This notebook demonstrates time-series forecasting using ARIMA models. We use a reproducible synthetic 
  price series (from Project 1 / Project 2), make it stationary, choose ARIMA orders via AIC-based 
  grid search (small grid), fit the model, produce multi-step forecasts with confidence intervals, and 
  evaluate performance with common metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE).
🔗 [View Notebook](https://github.com/pixelskysolutions/stock-price-analysis/blob/main/MODULE-4/Time_Series_ARIMA_Forecasting.ipynb)

📘 MODULE 5: MACHINE LEARNING FOR FINANCE

🔸PROJECT 1: CREDIT RISK MODELING WITH LOGISTIC REGRESSION
  In this notebook, we build and evaluate a logistic regression model to classify loan defaults using real/synthetic data. 
🔗 [View Notebook](https://github.com/pixelskysolutions/stock-price-analysis/blob/main/PHASE2/MODULE-5/project1_credit_risk_logreg.ipynb)

🔸PROJECT 2: STOCK RETURN PREDICTION WITH GRADIENT BOOSTING (XGBOOST)
  In this notebook we predict next-day returns based on lagged features, technical indicators, and market trends.
🔗 [View Notebook](https://github.com/pixelskysolutions/stock-price-analysis/blob/main/PHASE2/MODULE-5/project2_stock_return_xgboost.ipynb)

🔸PROJECT 3: ML PIPELINE FOR FINANCIAL DATA
  In this notebook we create a reusable ML pipeline for data cleaning, model training, and evaluation.
🔗 [View Notebook](https://github.com/pixelskysolutions/stock-price-analysis/blob/main/PHASE2/MODULE-5/project3_ml_pipeline_finance.ipynb)

📘 MODULE 6: QUANTITATIVE TRADING & BACKTESTING

🔸PROJECT 1: ALGORITHMIC TRADING BOT – MEAN REVERSION STRATEGY  
In this notebook, we design, backtest, and visualize a mean-reversion trading bot using Bollinger-band or z-score signals.  
🔗 [View Notebook](https://github.com/pixelskysolutions/stock-price-analysis/blob/main/PHASE2/MODULE-6/project1_backtesting_engine.ipynb)

🔸PROJECT 2: MOMENTUM STRATEGY WITH ROLLING SIGNALS  
We generate buy/sell signals based on short- and long-term moving averages (EMA 50/200), evaluate rolling PnL, and perform parameter sensitivity analysis.  
🔗 [View Notebook](https://github.com/pixelskysolutions/stock-price-analysis/blob/main/PHASE2/MODULE-6/project2_momentum_strategy.ipynb)

🔸SUB-PROJECT: EMA PARAMETER SEARCH OPTIMIZATION  
A complementary notebook that tests multiple EMA combinations to find the most robust momentum configuration.  
🔗 [View Notebook](https://github.com/pixelskysolutions/stock-price-analysis/blob/main/PHASE2/MODULE-6/project2_ema_param_search.ipynb)

🔸PROJECT 3: PORTFOLIO BACKTESTING ENGINE  
A modular backtesting engine that merges machine-learning and rule-based strategies, computes performance metrics (CAGR, Sharpe, drawdown), and exports detailed logs & CSV summaries.
