# ðŸ“Š Module 3: Probability, Statistics & Risk

This module introduces the foundations of **probability and statistics** in finance.  
We use simple simulations (coins, dice) to build intuition, then extend the concepts to stock returns and financial risk.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
- Understand probability basics (coins, dice, random variables).  
- Apply the **Law of Large Numbers** in simulations.  
- Explore probability distributions (normal, empirical).  
- Connect probability to **financial risk** via stock return simulations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
Probability and statistics are the **foundation of modern finance**.  
In this module, we explore randomness, uncertainty, and risk â€” building intuition through simulations and applying it directly to **financial returns** and **risk metrics**.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways
- Randomness and probability drive financial outcomes.  
- Simulations (coins, dice, stock returns) build strong intuition for uncertainty.  
- Risk metrics like **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** quantify potential losses, but they are not predictions â€” they are **risk boundaries**.  
- Each VaR method has trade-offs:
  - Historical: data-driven, no assumptions  
  - Parametric: fast, assumes normality  
  - Monte Carlo: flexible, computationally intensive
