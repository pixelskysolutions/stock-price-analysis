# ðŸ“Š Module 3: Probability, Statistics & Risk

This module introduces the foundations of **probability and statistics** in finance.  
We use simple simulations (coins, dice) to build intuition, then extend the concepts to stock returns and financial risk.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
- Understand probability basics (coins, dice, random variables).  
- Apply the **Law of Large Numbers** in simulations.  
- Explore probability distributions (normal, empirical).  
- Connect probability to **financial risk** via stock return simulations.
